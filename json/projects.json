This was due to how complex and personalized a project can be, which led to thinking of another communication channel with a faster response and better management of these clients.",
      "solution": "To address the issue, I developed a retail web application using technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Strapi, and PostgreSQL. The website enabled customers to quickly and easily obtain product specification and pricing information, significantly improving the customer experience. In addition, I implemented an estimate costing function for the work. I used Next.js to develop the hybrid application both on the server side, which allowed for better search engine optimization, and on the client, which allowed for a better user interface experience.",
      "outcome": "As a result, the retailer was able to significantly improve customer satisfaction and reduce response times for information on prices and product specifications. The advanced search function and the construction cost calculation system also made the customer's shopping experience more efficient. Overall, my ability to apply modern web technologies such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Strapi, and PostgreSQL enabled me to develop an effective and efficient solution that improved customer experience and increased customer satisfaction for retail."

The project arose from the need to provide a solution to companies affected by the in-person restrictions during the pandemic, specifically in the consumption of fashion products, allowing companies to enter the virtual market and promoting free trade and healthy competition among merchants.",
